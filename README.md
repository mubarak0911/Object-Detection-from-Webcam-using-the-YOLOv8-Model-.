# Object-Detection-from-Webcam-using-the-YOLOv8-Model-.
This project implements a real-time object detection system using Python, leveraging the YOLOv8 deep learning model and the OpenCV library. It captures live video frames from a webcam, processes them with the YOLOv8 model to identify and classify objects, and then overlays bounding boxes and labels onto the video stream.
