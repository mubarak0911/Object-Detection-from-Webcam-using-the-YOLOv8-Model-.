# Object-Detection-from-Webcam-using-the-YOLOv8-Model-.
This project implements a real-time object detection system using Python, leveraging the YOLOv8 deep learning model and the OpenCV library. It captures live video frames from a webcam, processes them with the YOLOv8 model to identify and classify objects, and then overlays bounding boxes and labels onto the video stream. 



The primary language used to implement this project is Python .

The key libraries and frameworks involved are:

- YOLOv8 (via Ultralytics library): This is a deep learning model for object detection, and we're interacting with it through its Python API.
- OpenCV (via opencv-python ): This is a powerful library for computer vision tasks, used here for accessing the webcam, processing video frames, and drawing bounding boxes and labels.
